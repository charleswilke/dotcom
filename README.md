# CharlesWilke.com

Welcome to the repo behind [CharlesWilke.com](https://charleswilke.com)—my cozy digital home on the internet.  

This repository contains all the code, assets, and creative bits that power my personal website. Feel free to poke around!

## What You'll Find Here

- **HTML/CSS/JS:** The nuts and bolts of my web presence.
- **Content:** Musings, essays, and explorations on AI, creativity, capitalism, and whatever else captures my imagination.
- **Images & Media:** Visual storytelling that's part French pop-art, part pulp-noir, and always thought-provoking.

## Tech Stack

- Simple and sturdy HTML/CSS with just a dash of JavaScript.
- Hosted lovingly via DreamHost, deploying automatically with Git magic.

## Why Open Source?

Because sharing ideas (and code) is good karma. If you see something useful, inspiring, or questionable, drop me a line or raise an issue.
