charleswilke.com

Welcome to the guts of my dot com.

This repo houses the source files for charleswilke.com — a personal site slash living portfolio slash quiet rebellion against generic LinkedIn bios. It’s where I keep a curated archive of writing, AI experiments, theater work, and whatever else refuses to fit into a tidy professional box.

What’s Here
	•	Static HTML/CSS/JS — hand-rolled, artisanal, lightly neurotic.
	•	Site sections include:
	•	A homepage that says hello like I mean it
	•	Links to my Substack and projects from my AI consultancy, Fellow Vector
	•	Some lovingly selected work samples
	•	Probably a dog photo or two if you poke around hard enough

Why?

Because I wanted something of mine to load instantly, look like me, and speak like a person—not a pitch deck.

Deployment

Deployed to DreamHost via good ol’ FTP. GitHub Actions is set up to auto-deploy on main branch pushes, because I’m fancy like that now.

Can I Use This?

Sure, poke around. If you’re here to see how someone built a site without JavaScript frameworks or a 4MB hero image, you’re in the right place.

Just don’t rip off the writing. It’s personal, and the dogs will know.
